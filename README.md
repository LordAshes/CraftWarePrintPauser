# CraftWarePrintPauser

Inserts a pause for X seconds after every Y layers allowing print to be stopped and continued.

Purpose:

When the printer pauses after printing every Y layers, the print can be stopped and the layer height recorded.
Afterwards my SessionSlicer application (https://github.com/LordAshes/SessionSlicer) can be used to split the
orignal gCode file into two sessions using the recorded height. This allows the print to be continued at a later
time.

If this application is not used and the print is stopped, although the layer height can be read off the printer
display, there is no guarantee that the printer has finished printing the current layer and thus it is hard to
determine at what point in the original gCode the next session should resume.

As a bonus, the printer display indicate the layer that it is printing.

Usage:

CraftWarePrintPauser file.gCode layersBeforePause pauseTime

e.g. CraftWarePrintPauser model.gCode 10 5

Compatibility:

This application is compatible with any gCode files which identify the next layer using:

; Layer #

GCode files generated by the default slicer in CraftWare are compatible with this application. If your chosen
software has a slightly different syntax for ientifying layers, it should be fairly easy to modify the code to
accept other formats.
